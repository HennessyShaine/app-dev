*Frozen* tells the story of Princess Anna as she teams up with an iceman, his reindeer, and a snowman to find her estranged sister Elsa, whose icy powers have inadvertently trapped their kingdom in eternal winter.
My favorite line in **Frozen** is > blockquote **"Let it go"** because this means that you must let go of everything that holds a person back and pushes them down.
